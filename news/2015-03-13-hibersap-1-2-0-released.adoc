We are happy to announce the Hibersap 1.2.0 release!

The artifacts for the new Hibersap version can be found in Maven central.

Besides the enhancements, we changed the license under which the Hibersap project is distributed from the Lesser GNU Public License (LGPL) to the Apache License. This should make it easier to integrate Hibersap with other libraries.
