Hibersap helps developers of Java applications to call business logic in SAP ERP.
Hibersap defines a link:#hibersap-annotations[set of Java annotations] to map SAP function modules to Java classes as well as a small, clean link:#calling-sap-functions[API] to execute these function modules and handle transaction and security aspects.
Hibersap's programming model is quite similar to those of modern O/R mappers, significantly speeding up the development of SAP interfaces and making it much more fun to write the integration code.

Under the hood, Hibersap either uses the SAP Java Connector (JCo) or a JCA compatible resource adapter to communicate with the SAP backend.
While retaining the benefits of JCo and JCA like transactions, security, connection pooling, etc., developers can focus on writing business logic because the need for boilerplate code is largely reduced.

Hibersap can either be link:#programmatic-configuration[configured programmatically] or by providing an link:#xml-file-configuration[XML file].
Switching between JCo and JCA is a sole matter of configuration, the program code remains unchanged.
This makes it possible to execute integration tests via JCo while using a resource adapter in the production environment.

Regarding link:#type-conversion[data type conversion] from ABAP to Java types, Hibersap per default uses the conversion as is done by JCo resp. the JCA Resource Adapter.
link:#custom-converters[Custom converters] may be used to implement special conversion logic.
Hibersap will then call the conversion code on-the-fly, before and after calling the function module in SAP.

Hibersap may be configured to use link:#bean-validation[Bean Validation (JSR 303)] to validate field values according to the standard Bean Validation annotations.

If the function module defines a standard Return structure or table, Hibersap is able to automatically detect an error state and throw a SapException which includes the information returned by SAP.

For link:#java-ee-integration[Java EE applications] it is recommended to use a resource adapter since it integrates seamlessly with Java EE containers.
Using the link:#hibersap-ejb-tools[Hibersap EJB] tools makes it very easy to call SAP from EJB methods making use of Container Managed Transactions and Container Managed Security.
In a managed environment calls to SAP functions may even be part of distributed transactions.

For advanced use cases, there are two types of interceptors that work on different levels of the call stack.

In the next chapters you will see out how easy it is to use Hibersap.
