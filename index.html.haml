      %h3 The fun way to connect to SAP
      %p
        Hibersap helps developers of Java applications to call business logic and access data in SAP backends.
        It defines a set of Java annotations to map SAP function modules to Java classes as well as a small,
        clean API to execute these function modules and handle transaction and security aspects.
      %p
        Hibersap's programming model is quite similar to those of modern O/R mappers, significantly speeding up
        the development of SAP interfaces and making it much more fun to write the integration code.
      %p
        Under the hood, Hibersap either uses the SAP Java Connector (JCo) or a JCA compatible resource adapter
        to communicate with the SAP backend. While retaining the benefits of JCo and JCA like transactions,
        security, connection pooling, etc., developers can focus on writing business logic because the need for
        boilerplate code is largely reduced.

    %h3 About 
    %p Awestruct is a framework for creating static HTML sites. It's inspired by the awesome Jekyll utility in the same genre. Additionally, Awestruct integrates technologies such as Compass, Markdown and Haml.

    %h3 Goal
    %p The goal of Awestruct is to make it trivially easy to bake out non-trivial static websites. In addition to providing template-driven site creation (using Haml), Awestruct provides facilities for easily priming the site creation with additional non-page data.

    %h3 Concept
    %p The core concept of Awestruct is that of structures, specifically Ruby OpenStruct structures. The struct aspect allows arbitrary, schema-less data to be associated with a specific page or the entire site.
